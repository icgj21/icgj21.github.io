## Welcome to ICGJ

We are pleased to announce the sixth annual International Conference on Game Jams, Hackathons, and Game Creation Events (ICGJ 2021). ICGJ is an interdisciplinary conference for educators, researchers, professionals, and event organizers across various fields related to game jams and hackathons. The one-day conference will be hosted online and is virtually co-located with Foundations of Digital Games ([FDG 2021](http://fdg2021.org/)). The conference builds on an expanding number of conferences, workshops series and research evaluating, enhancing, and improving game creation events. We will publish the proceedings in the ACM Digital Library, as in previous editions.

### Aims & Scope

Game jams and hackathons have become popular activities with their own unique cultures and the communities they spring. Often held in confined spaces for a limited duration of time, these activities offer enormous technological and social benefits for their participants. Studies can be conducted around the technical creation aspect of the activity, as well as on emerging social and educational dynamics. The research area today has a diverse and dedicated following of scholars. We especially invite contributions describing how COVID-19 has impacted game jams and hackathons: how they were managed online, lessons learned, etc.


### Topics

Major topics of interest this year will include (but are not limited to) the following:

- Communication skills
- Community building
- Creativity
- Educational dimension of game jams and hackathons
- Game design issues in game jams
- Games Done Quick
- Game jam and hackathon attendance: who and why?
- Game jam and hackathon impacts
- Game jam and hackathon methodologies
- Game jam and hackathon resources and assets
- Group dynamics
- Ideation
- Incentives and rewards in game jams and hackathons
- Learning in game jams and hackathons
- Makerspaces
- Online game jams and hackathons
- Rapid game development
- Team formation
- Theme development

### Submissions

Four categories of original submissions are considered:

- **Full Papers:** Full papers should be 6-8 pages long (excluding references), ready for publication in the conference proceedings.
- **Short Papers:** Short papers should be no more than 4 pages long (excluding references), ready for publication in the conference proceedings.
- **Game Jam or Hackathon Event Reports:** Game jam or hackathon event reports are for participants who want to present a report on a game jam or a hackathon at the conference. Reports should highlight lessons learned and eventually provide guidelines about event format, dynamics and organization. The evaluation will be based on usefulness of the takeaway. Event Reports should be no more than 4 pages (excluding references), ready for publication in the conference proceedings.
- **Game Jam Game or Project Showcase Reports:** Game jam game or project showcase reports should be no more than 2 pages. The showcase submission should include a summary of the development of the game or project. Each report must include a link to the file that was submitted to a game jam or hackathon. We highly encourage submissions to include a link to a demo video of the project (no longer than 5 minutes). These will be featured on the conference Web site but will not be published in the conference proceedings.

Full and short paper submissions will undergo a **double-blind review process** (i.e., identification of authors or their institutions must not appear anywhere in the article's text). The previous conference proceedings have been published in the ACM Digital Library, the same is expected for 2021. Paper submissions should utilize the double column ACM template which is available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow). These submissions need to be anonymized (remove all authors and affiliations) and uploaded to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icgj2021) before the deadline.

Event and showcase report submissions will undergo a **single-blind review process** (i.e., identification of authors have to be in the text of the report). Selected submissions will be published on the ICGJ 2021 website and presented at the conference. Report submissions should utilize the double column ACM template which is available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow). These submissions do NOT need to be anonymized. They should be uploaded to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icgj2021) before the deadline.

For LaTeX users, please use the following to enable the double-column format in the ACM template:
```
\\documentclass\[sigconf,authordraft\]{acmart}
```
